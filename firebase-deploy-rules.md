# Firebase Security Rules Deployment Guide

## 🔒 Security Rules Setup

Now that your Firebase is in production mode, you need to deploy the security rules to protect your data.

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. Install Firebase CLI globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. Login to Firebase:
   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. Initialize Firebase in your project:
   ```bash
   firebase init
   ```

## 🚀 Deploy Firestore Rules

1. Copy the `firestore.rules` file to your Firebase project
2. Deploy the rules:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
   ```

## 📁 Deploy Storage Rules

1. Copy the `storage.rules` file to your Firebase project
2. Deploy the rules:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy --only storage
   ```

## 🔍 What These Rules Do

### Firestore Rules:
- **Animals**: Users can only read/write their own animals
- **Weight Records**: Users can only access records for their own animals
- **Height Records**: Users can only access records for their own animals
- **Medical Records**: Users can only access records for their own animals

### Storage Rules:
- **Animal Photos**: Users can only upload/access photos for their own animals
- **Medical Documents**: Users can only upload/access medical documents for their own animals

## ✅ Verification

After deploying, test that:
1. Users can create and manage their own animals
2. Users cannot access other users' data
3. All CRUD operations work correctly for authenticated users

## 🛡️ Security Features

- **Authentication Required**: All operations require valid user authentication
- **Data Ownership**: Users can only access data they own
- **Cross-Reference Validation**: Records are validated against animal ownership
- **Path-Based Security**: Storage uses user-specific paths

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules for syntax errors
2. Verify authentication is working correctly
3. Test with Firebase Emulator first: `firebase emulators:start`
